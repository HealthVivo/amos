Hi, 
I finished grading project 3 and there are some special students who violated the project's requirements.

Hi Jodie, 

I just received w-2 form, but it just mention my stipend and the tax I pay for my stipend, it does not say anything about my fellowship and the fellowship's tax. I wonder if I can claim that fellowship's tax and Do I need another w-2 form to declare my fellowship's tax?

Thank you so much.
Dzung Ta.
