AMOS Assembler NEWS
===================

   The first release of the AMOS (A Modular Open Source) Assembler is
now available for download.  Version 1.2.3 is the first version to be
released under the OSI Artistic License (see `COPYING') and freely
available to the public for download.  The AMOS project is still in
its early development stages, and everyone interested in improving
this project is strongly encouraged to contact us. See the project
website for more details.

   Currently the AMOS release comes with only _very_ limited user
documentation, and almost nil developer documentation.  We understand
that free software is useless without the proper documentation, so we
are working hard to make a comprehensive HTML users manual for the
entire project... stay tuned... developer documentation should follow.
In the meantime, we will be more than happy to provide support and
"virtual" documentation via Email.  PLEASE, do not hesitate to contact
us; you will receive a prompt reply.
